This recipe is perfect for salmon fillet, even though it calls for salmon steaks.  I cut up the salmon into individual portions and followed the instructions exactly.  I'm on one of those food combining diets, so I left out the white wine but added just a dash of white wine vinegar instead (just a little bit, not enough to change the taste of the dish).  Super yummy, and leftovers for lunch today (lucky me)!\"],\n",

Everyone really enjoyed this, including my picky picky 5 yo and the completely nonpicky 1 yo. :) I don't own a cast iron skillet (sacrilege, I know! :)), so I made it in my trusty stoneware pie plate.  Remembering how much this rises, I only filled the plate half full, and used the rest of the batter to make up 6 corn muffins.  Since I wasn't using the pan you say in the recipe, I kept an eye on it while cooking.  The muffins were done in 20 minutes and the larger one was done in about 30.  Also, no buttermilk in the house, so I used the usual substitution of 1 T. lemon and enough regular milk to make up one cup.  The rest was per recipe.\"],\n",

       "  'Before I get into my critique, please know that we loved the flavor of these. The coffee was great, Dutch cocoa a must and the sour cream made for a very tender cake. The glaze is TDF good, a fudgy smooth consistency, and even DH who doesn\\'t like coconut thought the shredded coconut on top was perfect. So, for taste we all would agree on a definite 5 stars. :) My concern is that the recipe could benefit from some modifications & clarifications. The first thing I would want to point out is that the recipe as printed doesn\\'t make just \"large\" cupcakes. It will make JUMBO cupcakes. I don\\'t have a jumbo pan so I would have cut the recipe down had I known before hand. Instead I ended up making 36 regular sized cupcakes & because they had to be cooled in the pan before removing to wire rack (& because of the cakes\\' texture, this was in fact necessary) it took 3 hours just to bake all 36 cakes (2 days from start to finish). As far as the recipe, I think there is much too much butter. So much that the muffin tins felt as if I\\'d greased them before putting the paper liners in, but I didn\\'t. I also think the amount of sugar called for is overkill. They didn\\'t taste overly sweet, but the tops of the cakes are nearly caramelized. The butter sank to the bottom & made the cake greasy while the sugar floated to the top & turned into a sticky candy coating. Removing the cakes from the pan &/or removing the paper liners without tearing the entire top of the cake was a very slow & tedious process. I did enough to get a satisfactory photo but will just let everyone remove their own now. :) Again, this recipe is worth the effort in flavor & we would give 5 stars for that. Thanks for sharing, my3bb! Made for ZWT5-Ali Baba\\'s Babes.  UPDATE:  It\\'s been 4 days since I made these & they\\'ve been sitting out on the counter the whole time (not covered or sealed).  I just finished eating one & cannot believe that it\\'s still SO GOOD!  They\\'re not greasy anymore & still aren\\'t dried out.  The cake is still moist & only just approaching the \"day old\" stage around the top edge that isn\\'t in paper or covered in frosting.  The frosting is like biting into a rich, creamy fudge & was such a nice surprise.  I\\'m tempted to say that making these a day or two ahead of an event would be just perfect as far as their aging to perfection & the convenience of being able to make a baked good ahead.  :)'],\n",

It had already been a long day, and I just wanted something *Cool* to eat, so I was drawn to the recipe, as I know I will never be let down. Before going to the barn in the afternoon, I quickly chopped the cucumber, salted them, and put them in a colander to drain. I took out the cream cheese and put on the counter. In the greenhouse I have beautiful chives and small green onions growing so I don\\'t know how I could of been more set. I even had a homemade loaf of bread that was very crusty on the outside but soft on the inside. Perfect! Upon returning home, I squeezed the cucumber juice out mixed up and folded them in the cream cheese and went off to sit down for a moment. I couldn\\'t stand it a moment longer, so I flew back to the fridge and blasted my bread with a good helping of chive and cucumber spread and I was in heaven. This was so perfect, I couldn\\'t think of anything that would make me happier. \\nThank you FT! Made for *Spring Spectacular* April 2008'],\n",

I used 3/4 cup whole milk, then added 1 cup fat free milk after I had stirred and realized the potatoes were still too thick. It came out perfectly.  I added approximately 5 tablespoons of the caramelized onions and used a hand blender to mix it all in.  Didn't do roasted garlic cloves, so just added about a tablespoon of garlic powder.

Very staight-forward preparation, the biggest challenge is getting the filled wrappers into a uniform eye pleasing shape. I did sustitute ground turkey (didn't have a chilli pepper), opted for peas, and otherwise stuck to the recipe. The first test batch was less than impressive, the wonton wrappers were a dry/crisp and dull, so after asking-used a very light brush of oil and a pinch of salt made them soft and inviting(can also use cooking oil spray). I found the spice level/combination very agreeable but felt it was repetitious(maybe because of the turkey being less powerful than beef) and in need something. I noticed other people use rasins or sultanas so I chopped some for a second test batch--yummy! They added a needed contrast for my liking and the taste was complete. I wanted to give 5 stars but I've never had Samosas before so I can't say how traditional these taste.\\nAs far as quantity,I made 12-15 filled wonton wraps and filled a small burrito wrap for neighbor to munch on and still had about 3/4 of the mixture remaining (in the fridge for tommorow) so I'd say #60 individual peices easily. This is a great filling to make ahead or freeze for time saving convenience.\\nThumbs up!\"],\n",

Regarding cooking time, make sure to cook for the full 15 minutes at the end because my rice was undercooked when I put it in \"just until cheese melts\"; thankfully, I was able to toss it back in the oven for the remaining time and all was well.  Because we\\'re only a houseful of two, I like casseroles that I can split and freeze half for another meal.  I\\'m not sure the cabbage will hold up well in the freezer, but I might give it a try one of these days (cooking for the first 45 minutes, letting cool completely, topping with cheese, and then tossing in the freezer).  Anyway, thanks for the recipe!  I\\'m always glad to have something quick, easy, and filled with veggies!'],\n",

I also garnished with some fresh basil, and some ancho chile powder, both flavors that really enhance the corn.  Although the recipe calls for straining the mixture before serving, I opted not to, and instead used a hand blender to puree it even more finely in the pan.  I like the texture this way, and so did DH.  He actually thought it should be a bit thicker, which I may accomplish next time by adding a little flour between steps one and two.  My only issue, and it's a minor one, was the balance of flavor between the corn and the onion.  I thought the onion was a little strong, so next time I think I'll either use a little less, or use a sweet onion instead of the plain yellow onion that I used this time.  Overall, a very good recipe, that I will definately make again.  This was very easy to make, and well suited to a light weeknight dinner.  Made for ZWT5 by one of the Cooks with Dirty Faces.\"],\n",

I did make a few minor changes the first of which was to use yellow onion instead of green (for two reasons one we like the taste of onion and two because that was what I had on hand.) the other was to cut the brown sugar in half and was glad I did or it would have been too sweet for our taste. Did see were another reviewer thought it need a little something and reading the recipe thought it sounded like it need some garlic so just sprinkled a little garlic powder over before cooking.

       "  'I did it! I made this recipe (six times) to feed our church members for a special breakfast today. It really is simple to make for a crowd. I just lightly mixed the milk mixture in a blender and I mixed the topping the night before and stored on the counter in Ziplock bags (made for easy clean up).I used some 13x9 foil pans and 1 lb French bread.  This  turned out perfectly and I received MANY compliments! The best compliment was when someone asked if there was yeast in it, like in cinnamon rolls. I explained that it just puffs up when baked. I think that is the neatest part of it! I had pancake syrup for a topping but most ate it plain (but this dish is anything but plain!) and sprinkled it liberally with powdered sugar. For ease of cutting I reccomend lining the two layers up together. I suggest to others to let the casserole rest before cutting and lift up some pieces of the bread so the melted butter distributes throughout the pan. This looked gorgeous and I think it was the \"hit\" of the breakfast (if I do say so myself!). Thanks Kozmic Blues, for posting.\\nRoxygirl'],\n",

I always approach kugel recipes as fair game: an opportunity to vary what I throw in and what I omit according to the whim of the moment.  It was a while since I'd made kugel so I approached making this dish with considerable enthusiasm.  I made a few changes because of personal taste preferences and a few additions because I love the additional ingredients.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce and used only 1/2 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce (we have almost zero tolerance of anything hot and spicy), I doubled the garlic and I added an onion and one leek: just love the combination of onions, garlic and leek.  I also added a cup of thinly sliced mushrooms.  I added basil and oregano (as in the ingredients list) but also added rosemary, sage and thyme. I used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat sour cream as I find that low-fat versions of these makes no appreciable difference to the final dish.  Once all the ingredients had been combined, I added two eggs - as eggs have featured in most other kugel recipes I've made.  I baked the kugel in several smaller dishes as two were destined for the freezer.  I look forward to making this again - probably quite differently next time.

We had them along with a nice scoop of French Vanilla ice cream.  Everyone here really enjoyed a lot!  I loved the flavor of the roasted nuts along with the raspberry preserves.  Next time I may make a sauce with fresh raspberries or strawberries.  It would be great to change up the berries or do some combinations.  Mine came out bar-like, not cake like, which I liked.  I didn't stir them too much, just mixed to incorporate the ingredients, but didn't beat to death.  We will have these again, and from the thumbs up from my company it may be sooner than I think!  Thanks and good luck with the contest!\"],\n",

       "  'Too Good!!  I\\'m still dreaming about these nummies.  Had only made cake donuts before, never yeast. My youngest had commented recently how he\\'d really like to try one of those \"Krispy Kreme\" donuts everyone on TV is always talking about (they are no Krispy Kremes here in Alaska).  We tried this recipe with wonderful results!!  Made the entire batch and then froze half of them in a big ziplock bag. I recommend freezing..they were great thawed by popping them in the microwave to gently warm.  \\nWe discovered it is best to wait until the donuts are almost cool to dip in the glaze. Otherwise the glaze isn\\'t quite thick enough. Next time we\\'ll try maple favoring etc, just for fun. \\nI found cooking them at 365 for the full 2 minutes a side was fine, but they got a little over brown, so I shortened it up a bit. It isn\\'t the recipe, but how big you cut each donut..mine must have been on the small side.  \\n Thank you Lorri, we\\'ll be making these way too often (g)'],\n",
